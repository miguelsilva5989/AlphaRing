## What's New in This Fork

### Features Added

#### 1. Controller-to-Player Binding (Splitscreen)
- Each player now has a **"Bind" button** next to the controller dropdown
- Click "Bind" → Press any button on a controller → Automatically assigns that controller to the player
- No more guessing which controller is "Controller 1" vs "Controller 2"

#### 2. Button-to-Action Binding (Gamepad Mapping)
- Each action in the Gamepad Mapping section has a **"Bind" button**
- Click "Bind" → Press a button → That button is assigned to the action

#### 3. Fixed Default Gamepad Mappings
- **Bug fixed:** Previously, all actions defaulted to "Left Trigger" due to uninitialized memory
- **Now:** New profiles initialize with standard Xbox Halo controls:

| Action | Button |
|--------|--------|
| Jump | A |
| Melee | B |
| Action/Interact | X |
| Change Weapon | Y |
| Reload | RB |
| Switch Grenades | LB |
| Shoot | RT |
| Throw Grenade | LT |
| Flashlight | D-pad Up |
| Crouch | Left Stick Click |
| Zoom | Right Stick Click |

### Features

* Object Browser (H3)

### Installation
Make sure you have the latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) installed.

Download the latest stable build from the [Releases](https://github.com/kirklandsig/AlphaRing/releases) page.

Place the DLL into the "Halo The Master Chief Collection\mcc\binaries\win64" directory and launch the game with EAC off.

For Running on Steam Deck/Linux, add the following command in the Steam Game Launch Options:
```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="WTSAPI32=n,b" %command%
```

#### Batocera Linux

For Batocera Linux users, additional setup is required:

1. **Download Proton GE**: Get the latest `tar.gz` from the [Proton GE releases page](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases) (Proton GE 10-15 or newer recommended)

2. **Install Proton GE**: Unpack the archive to your Steam compatibility tools folder:
   ```
   ~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/
   ```

3. **Restart Steam**: Close and reopen the Steam client for it to detect the new Proton version

4. **Configure the game**:
   - Right-click MCC → Properties → Compatibility
   - Enable "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool"
   - Select **Proton GE 10-15** (or your installed version)

5. **Set launch options**: Add the following to Steam Launch Options:
   ```
   WINEDLLOVERRIDES="WTSAPI32=n,b" %command%
   ```

> **Note:** The unofficial Batocera add-ons version of the Steam client has been tested and works with this setup.

### Usage
Toggle menu: `F4` or `Controller Back` + `Controller Start`

To navigate using Controller use the `Right Stick` to move the mouse and `RB` to click.

When the menu is open, game input is disabled.
